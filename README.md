# ANN-Melody
 an attempt at a generative artificial neural network for melodies. the purpose of this project is to prove that creativity is necessary for the generation of unique and interesting melodies, and AI does not posess such a capability. This is because each possible next note is valued at some objective probability by the generative AI, the same way LLMs generate words. In order to get any variation in what the AI ever generates, you must use random numbers "heat." Random numbers are not a component to the operation of your brain, creativity goes in its place. this is my hypothesis anyway.
